# Hello üëã

Thank you for your interest in Bits of Good! This assessment is designed to showcase your practical skills as a developer. The tasks included reflect the skills most often used by developers at BoG. If you have questions or find any part unclear, please file a GitHub issue and add `@uma-anand`as an assignee.

The assessment has front-end and back-end portions, which can be completed independently or together if you are a full-stack developer. **You are not expected to complete everything.** Focus on code quality over quantity to demonstrate _how you write and organize code_.

The project includes a pre-defined file structure and sample code to guide you. Feel free to modify anything as needed‚Äî nothing is set in stone.

Files and folders with a `mock` designation are for the mock-backend used in the front-end portion. If you are working on the back-end, you can skip these files but review them for context on the code structure.

### Submission ‚úÖ

Before submission, make sure you run eslint using `npm run lint` and you get no warnings or errors. If for any reason you have to disable a rule in a file, leave a comment in the file explaining why. To submit, share the link to your repository in your application. If you are a backend developer, make sure your repository includes any environment/database variables used!

### Stack üíª

This project has been bootstrapped using Next.js, React, and Tailwind. The programming language used is TypeScript. We expect developers to use the same technologies. However, this is not a limit on libraries- feel free to import any helpful libraries. For backend developers, while implementing the database, we expect you to use MongoDB. These requirements are there to mimic the stack most often used by Bits of Good. [We also recommend you use a code formatter like Prettier, but it is not a mandatory requirement for this take-home.]

## Scenario ‚ù§Ô∏è

_Crisis Corner_ is a non-profit that handles requests for items in areas that are affected by natural disasters. Their current Admin Portal currently only has a form where you manually type in items to approve them. You are part of a team working with them to build a better Admin Portal where they can manage received item requests in a more nuanced fashion.

## Getting Started üê£

To get started, fork this repository on GitHub. Then clone onto your local machine. Read [this](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) if you are unfamiliar with doing that.

We recommend you have a Node.js version > 18.0.

First, install all the dependencies for this project by running `npm install` from the root of this project.

The run the development server using `npm run dev`.

If you are using yarn or another package manager, run the equivalent commands.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the already implemented landing page.

You can start editing the code now! The project uses the [Next.js App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app) with a [`src` folder](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/src-directory).

## First Task üê•

Now that you have the repository and the application set up locally, you are ready for the first task! This is for everyone regardless of whether you are a front-end/back-end/full-stack developer. We want to get to know you better!

Go to [http://localhost:3000/cool](http://localhost:3000/cool) or press the "Something cool!" button in the homepage. This is a space for you to write something unique or interesting about you- it can be anything - don't sweat it! Just edit the `src/app/cool/page.tsx` file.

## Onwards üêî

All your remaining tasks are based on whether you are a front-end/back-end developer. Navigate yourself to either `FRONTEND.md` or `BACKEND.md` for instructions. If you are a full-stack developer, you can do any amount of tasks from both in any order but we recommend you do the back-end portion first.
